# Maze-solver
## A simple GUI maze visualizer and solver made in Java

Written for an assignment in the course IN1010 objectoriented programming, at University of Oslo. The program utilizes **javax** and **swing** for the user interface.

## User documentation

- Start the program in console by compiling and running **LabyrintSystem3000**
- You will be prompted to select a labyrith file (some included in this repo)
- On selection the program will generate the labyrinth and display it onscreen in a dynamic resizeable window
- Click squares in the labyrinth to find all possibla exit-paths from that point
- If more are present, use the controlpanel to cycle through, or the list to select a specific path.
- The program reads and creates representations of all labyrinths in the correct format (keep in mind, at some point a labyrinth may be to large to be represented correctly!)

## Customization
- The programs color scheme is easely customizable in the code with color-tags for each element in the GUI
- The elements themselves are made to be customized to some extent if needed.
